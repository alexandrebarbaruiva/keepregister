### Keep Register

A tiny terminal app that helps you to keep track of your development journey with date and hour of each entry.

### Usage

First argument is the file name, which if not exists will be created. The second argument is the message to register, between quotes.

```bash
$ keepregister example.txt "Today i had some problem with the database and i'm waiting the DB manager to fix this."
```

Simple as that!!!
